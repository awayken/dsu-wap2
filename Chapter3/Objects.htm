  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Object-oriented programming allows you to use objects that can be accessed by other programs, including Web pages.&nbsp;An object is a set of related methods and properties that are compartmentalized.
  Objects contain collections of methods and properties.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">  A method contains one or more programming statements. Methods are also known as functions.
  Functions are a group of programming commands. While you can define a method within a Web page, if a method is defined within an object, the code can be reused in many Web pages.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Properties are characteristics of the object that are assigned a name and value.
  You can use objects to store methods and properties that can be reused across applications.
